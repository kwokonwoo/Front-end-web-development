**Note:** The `overflow` property only works for block elements with a specified height.

`overflow-x` specifies what to do with the left/right edges of the content.

`white-space: nowrap;` Sequences of whitespace will collapse into a single whitespace. Text will never wrap to the next line. The text continues on the same line until a `<br>` tag is encountered.
